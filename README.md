# Talkdesk Problems

This repository contains the description of various problems that have
come up while working on Talkdesk.

Now that we have got a better appreciation of who you are, we would now like to get
a feel for the way you work. To do this, we would like you to collaborate with us on
solving a problem that we've encountered before.

Please understand that this is not a test or an exame, here there are no right and wrong
answers. This is just an opportunity for us to collaborate together and solve an interesting
problem. You also can get an understanding of the type of things we have to do in Talkdesk,
being a startup and all.

What we expect to learn about you from this is:

* Your working style
* How you think and solve problems
* How you communicate

And what we expect you'll learn about us is:

* How we work as a team
* The types of problems we deal with
